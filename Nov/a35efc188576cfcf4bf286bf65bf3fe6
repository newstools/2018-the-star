Ethiopia's first female supreme court president Meaza Ashenafi has assumed her office. She was sworn-in by parliament on Thursday, building on efforts by reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to achieve gender parity in government. Ashenafi's appointment comes two weeks after Abiy named 10 female ministers to make Ethiopia the third country in Africa - after Rwanda and Seychelles - to have its cabinet split equally between men and women. A prominent rights campaigner, Meaza recently served as an adviser on women's rights at the Addis Ababa-based United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Naming her as his pick to head the Supreme Court, Abiy told lawmakers the court system needed improved capacities "to successfully implement demands made with regards to justice, democracy and change in our country. "I have made the nomination with the firm belief that she has the capacity required, with her vast international experience in mind." Parliament unanimously approved Abiy's choice. Under Ethiopia's constitution, the court system operates independent of government. Last week the Horn of Africa country named Sahle-Work Zewde as president, also the first woman to hold that post.

But they have so far failed to curtail unrest with over two million people displaced this year due to clashes - many pitting different ethnic groups against each other - in several parts of the country.
