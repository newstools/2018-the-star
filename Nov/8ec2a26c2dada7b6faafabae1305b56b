The judiciary will construct more than 290 new courts countrywide to make justice accessible to Kenyans, Chief Justice David Maraga has said. He said every subcounty would have a court room because people suffer travelling long distances. Some court users, he noted, travel for hours only to find that their cases were postponed without their knowledge. He said the new courts will be ultra-modern with sufficient sanitary facilities and will be disabled persons-friendly. Maraga made the announcement while launching the new Kigumo law courts yesterday. He said the new courts will be comfortable for court users and provide a better working condition for officials, resulting to more efficient services. Local leaders will decide on the appropriate sites of the new court rooms, he added. Maraga said he had a meeting with political leaders yesterday morning and agreed to have a sitting that will categorise areas that should be priorotised in the project dubbed the Judicial Performance Improvement Project. It is funded by the World Bank. “Some subcounties will have two new courts due to the high number of cases in the ares,” he added. The judiciary is also committed to ensure cases that are more than five years old are concluded before the end of the year, he said. From next year, it will embark on cases that are more than four years old to ease the backlog of cases in courts. Maraga said he is working on resolving numerous cases involving people living in the diaspora, who get swindled as they attempt to buy properties through relatives. He said more judges will be employed from next year to handle cases of land succession that have been blamed for increased crime in areas like Murang’a.  He directed court officials to translate court proceedings for court users, whether they have legal representation or not.  Governor Mwangi wa Iria said he had allocated a two acres next to Murang’a prison for the expansion of Murang’a law courts.
