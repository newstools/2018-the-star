Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli's estranged third wife Roselinda Simiyu has dismissed his claim that he met his wife Mary Kilobi in 2005. "The two met in 2015. That time he is claiming he met Kilobi and that I was with him, I had just given birth and had so many health complications that could not allow me to travel," Roselinda told Radio Jambo. In a recent interview, Atwoli said he met the KTN anchor in 2005 in Kampala, when she was working with Uganda Broadcasting Corporation and was with his second wife. Speculation has been rife that Kilobi married Atwoli because of his status and wealth. Roselinda says she helped her former husband and even contributed to his success. "If you get money and lack wisdom, that is very wrong, and that is why he lost direction. Kilobi does not know how Atwoli got the money," Roselinda said. "I have no problem with him marrying again. I am a Bukusu. If amependa, that is his right, but what I know is he is not the same man I have known from the start." She advises women to not depend so much on their husbands because they might leave and you will be left with no one to depend on. "I trusted him so much and went out of my way to be with him, but when time for him to go comes, he will go. I was dependent on him and that is why I am in this situation," she said, referring to her claims that he's stopped providing for her family.
