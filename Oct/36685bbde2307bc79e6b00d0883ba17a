Legislators from Nandi county have defended Deputy President William Ruto against claims that he was undermining President Uhuru Kenyatta. The MPs said Ruto is the president’s principal assistant, carrying out his mandate effectively. They included Nandi senator Samson Cherargey and MPs Julius Meli (Tinderet) and Wilson Kogo (Chessmen) and Vincent Tuwei (Mosop). The lawmakers said there was a scheme to drive a wedge between Ruto and the head of state. “When formed a formidable force by bringing together their parties to create the Jubilee alliance, some forces have never forgiven them,” Meli said. Meli said it is not true that that the DP had changed  his position because he has been travelling across the country on behalf of the president. The DP was earlier opposed to the referendum but has since backed the idea.
