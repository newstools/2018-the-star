A son of the owner of the eight-storey building that collapsed and killed one person and injured 26 other people last Friday lhas surrendered to the police. Shabbirali Fakhruddin, a son of Shabir Kasamale who died during the disaster, surrendered at the Directorate of Criminal Investigation after being in hiding since Friday. Detectives arrested site engineer Daniel Weshukhula Mukhonga on Friday. Security agents obtained court orders to hold him for 21 days pending investigations. Anthony Sunguti, the Malindi DCIO, said Fakrudin had already recorded statements with the police and will be taken to court. Sunguti said officers have received a list of the names of the engineers and were pursuing them. He said they are also loking for other directors of Palm Developers Limited, the company that owns the property which collapsed. “We are also following up government officers to find if they cleared the building for construction and if the right procedures were followed,” Sunguti said. The owner of the building died after the collapsed structure hit a house he was sleeping in during the 5am incident. The developers had been advertising the sale of two and three bedroom apartments starting from Sh6 million since 2017. Kilifi county director of NEMA Samuel Lopokoiyote said the building was condemned last year but the developers proceeded with construction.
