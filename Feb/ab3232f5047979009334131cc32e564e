Police investigating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have recommended to Israel's attorney general that he be charged with bribery in two cases, Israeli news media reported on Tuesday. Netanyahu, who denies wrongdoing, has been questioned several times since the start of 2017. Police can make only a recommendation; the final decision to indict rests with the attorney-general. Israeli media have reported that one of the two cases involves the receipt of gifts from businessmen and the other is related to conversations Netanyahu is alleged to have held with an Israeli newspaper publisher about limiting competition in the news sector in exchange for more positive coverage. Police were due to make the official announcement over their recommendations at 18:45 GMTand Netanyahu was due to respond with a live televised statement minutes later.
