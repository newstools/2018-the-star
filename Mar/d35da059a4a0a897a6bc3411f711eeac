Vladimir Putin will lead Russia for another six years, after securing an expected victory in the presidential election. With 50% of the vote counted he had received 75% of the vote, the central election commission said. The main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race. Addressing a rally in Moscow after the early results were declared, Putin said voters had "recognised the achievements of the last few years". The scale of victory - which had been widely predicted - appears to be a marked increase in his share of the vote from 2012, when he won 64%. Putin's nearest competitor, Pavel Grudinin, had received 13.2% so far, according to the central election commission. Grudinin is a millionaire communist, but the race also included a former reality television host, Ksenia Sobchak, and veteran nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. A state exit poll put the turnout at 63.7%, down on 2012. Mr Putin's campaign had hoped for a large turnout, to give him the strongest possible mandate. His campaign team said it was an "incredible victory". "The percentage that we have just seen speaks for itself. It's a mandate which Putin needs for future decisions, and he has a lot of them to make," a spokesman told Russia's Interfax. In some areas, free food and discounts in local shops were on offer near polling stations. Click here for the latest political news
