Julie Gichuru has responded to a man who begged her to let him be her 'toy boy'. In the long letter, she has highlighted that she is happily married to Simba, advising the guy to stop underselling himself, and even asked him to learn how to punctuate his sentences. The letter read in part:"I felt motivated to respond to your comment because you say you are working hard, hustling in Qatar. I congratulate you for your effort. I also noted that you seemed to offer or suggest that you are available as a ‘toy boy’. Allow me to say that’s not my thing, not at all. I am happily married to a Simba and by the grace of God we shall grow old together."
