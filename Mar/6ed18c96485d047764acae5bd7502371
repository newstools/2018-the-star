"Missing the World Indoor Championships ... because of #systemisdown!!!?” he posted on his Facebook account. "We must let go of the life we have planned, so as we accept the one that’s waiting for us. "When you work hard for your dreams some people don’t care but God is great. Isn't the end of everything." Korir confirmed he was still in New York, where he had applied for the visa. Click here for the latest political news
