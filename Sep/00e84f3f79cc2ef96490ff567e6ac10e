Zimbabwe's police on Wednesday
issued a ban on all public gatherings and illegal food vending
to control the spread of cholera, which has killed 21 people in
the capital Harare. The ban was announced a day after the government declared
the disease an emergency. National police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said it would
remain in place until the cholera outbreak was under control.
She urged members of the public to heed the ban as it would
assist in alleviating the spread of the disease. The main opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa, had planned to
hold a rally on Saturday where he may take a mock presidential
oath, three weeks after President Emmerson Mnangagwa was
inaugurated following a court decision upholding his disputed
election victory. Chamisa's spokesman Nkululeko Sibanda had no immediate
comment. The opposition leader visited clinics where cholera patients
were being treated earlier on Wednesday and called for
collaboration between city health officials and the government. Police also said they had stopped the selling of food by
illegal vendors on the streets in two of the most affected
suburbs and in the city centre. "Police will intensify patrols and surveillance in the
Harare central business district and will be out in full force
to ensure compliance with the government without fear or
favour," a police statement said. More than 3,000 people had been infected by cholera and the
disease had now spread outside the capital, Health Minister
Obadiah Moyo told a meeting of government departments. This is the biggest cholera outbreak since 2008 when 4,000
people died and more than 40,000 were treated for this disease,
according to ministry of health data. Click here for the latest political news
