Outgoing Democratic
Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila pledged at the United
Nations on Tuesday that "peaceful, credible" elections would be
held in his country as planned at the end of the year. Kabila has ruled since his father's assassination in 2001.
He agreed last month not to defy term limits by running for
re-election, opening the door to the Central African nation's
first democratic transfer of power. His announcement calmed tensions that have seen dozens of
anti-Kabila demonstrators killed by security forces since he
refused to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in
December 2016. "Despite the enormous challenges still lying cross our path
in many areas, just like last year, I now reaffirm the
irreversible nature of our decision to hold the elections as
planned at the end of this year," he told the annual UN
gathering of world leaders. "The political situation in my country is becoming
increasingly predictable and transparent," he said. "Everything
will be done in order to ensure that these elections are
peaceful and credible." Kabila is backing Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary in the
long-delayed December 23 poll. The latter's biggest challengers are likely to
be Felix Tshisekedi, the president of Congo's largest opposition
party, and Vital Kamerhe, who placed third in the last election
in 2011. Congo is Africa's top producer of copper and the world's
leading miner of cobalt, which is prized for its use in
batteries for electric cars and electronics. Also read: Kabila's decision to step aside won't change DRC's power dynamics Click here for the latest political news
