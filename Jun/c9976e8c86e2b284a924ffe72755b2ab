Kenya will publish a draft data
protection law this month to create safeguards for personal data
held by mobile phone-based lenders and others, Minister of
Information, Communication and Technology Joe Mucheru said on
Monday. It will specify how data can be stored and shared and will
take into account standards set by data protection laws outside
Kenya including in the European Union, Mucheru said. The government estimates that mobile phone-based financial
firms are lending more than 15 billion Kenya shillings ($148.51
million) daily, he said. "We cannot ignore the fact that we have become a digital
economy and therefore we need to have all the protections that
are needed," he told Reuters. The draft is the latest attempt to regulate a growing number
of phone-based lenders who range from large Kenyan firms like
Safaricom, which partners with local lenders, to
start-ups several of which are backed by Silicon Valley
investors. "It is something that we must do as a country," the minister
said. The bill be published within two weeks and the ministry
will develop a final version after input from the industry and
the public, before it is presented to parliament. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), adopted
last month, is seen as a landmark law that gives EU citizens new
rights over how their personal data are used. As it was for mobile money systems, Kenya is something of a
test case for the new lending platforms. The finance ministry published another draft bill last month
aimed at reining in the high interest rates charged by some of
those lenders on their loans to customers. Read: Senators back suspension of sections of Cybercrime law Click here for the latest political news
