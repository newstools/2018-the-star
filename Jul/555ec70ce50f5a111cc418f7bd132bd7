An aspiring prophet has been arrested in Ethiopia after he
failed to bring a dead man back to life. Getayawkal Ayele had tried to revive the corpse of Belay
Biftu by lying on top of him and repeatedly yelling "Belay, wake up". It was not successful, and his failure enraged family
members who began attacking Mr Getayawkal. He was saved when police arrived shortly afterwards -
although it did not mean he was out of trouble. Abusing dead bodies is a crime under Ethiopian law and a
local police commander has told the BBC that the man, whose real job is as a health
worker, is now in custody. The incident was filmed and has since gone viral on social
media. Residents in the small western town of Galilee, in the
Oromia region, said Getayawkal first went to the bereaved family and told
them the story of Lazarus - who according to the New Testament was brought back
to life by Jesus. They then appear to have agreed to dig up Belay. After the failed resurrection, several members of the family
fainted on the spot while others became angry and started beating Mr Getayawkal
- at which point police arrived and arrested him. Click here for the latest political news
