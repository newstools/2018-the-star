An NGO is set to open a state-of-the-art facility in Kenol, Murang’a county, to cater for children with special needs. US-based Cate Hope Foundation said they built the facility to alleviate the suffering of disabled children in their pursuit of education. Foundation director Cate Mburu said they will enrol the first 200 students on Saturday. Beneficiaries will enjoy free basic necessities, including food, clothes and vital equipment besides free education. Mburu said society had turned a blind eye to people with special needs. "We can’t continue enjoying life while our brothers and sisters suffer. We have a collective responsibility to uphold humanity," she said. Mburu spoke during a tour of Sabasaba in Maragua, where she donated wheelchairs, food and medicine. She urged elected leaders to create charitable foundations through which they can help those with special needs. "There is need for goodwill from the leaders, otherwise the country will not grow because funds for helping the needy will continue benefiting individuals," Mburu said. She praised President Uhuru Kenyatta for leading the fight against corruption. Mburu said Kenyans in diaspora were willing to invest in and develop the country. Mburu lives in the US where she was born. "As long as money donated to the needy is properly utilised, we are ready to invest here because we love our home country," she said.
