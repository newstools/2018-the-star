Kenya's economy is likely to expand by 6.2 percent this year, the Central bank's governor said on Tuesday, offering a rosier outlook than the Finance Ministry which expects growth of 5.8 percent. The economy expanded by 5.7 percent in the first quarter as farming, which accounts for close to a third of output, recovered from a drought in the same period a year earlier. The economy expanded by 4.9 percent in 2017. Patrick Njoroge, the governor, told a news conference the forecast was based on the economy's performance in the first quarter, a stronger agriculture sector and a jump in tourists' forward bookings. "We have a very favourable outlook for the economy," he said, adding however there were risks including an international trade war and a cap on commercial lending rates at home.
