Zimbabwe held its first election
on Monday since former president Robert Mugabe was ousted in a
de facto coup and European Union observers said the vote was
"very smooth" in some places and "totally disorganised" in
others. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a long-time ally of Mugabe,
faces opposition leader Nelson Chamisa in the vote. Mnangagwa is
the frontrunner but the latest poll shows a tight race. Read: Zimbabweans vote in first election since Mugabe's removal A credible election after Mugabe's 37-year rule is essential
if Zimbabwe is to exit painful sanctions imposed on the
government and secure the donor funding and investment needed to
stem chronic cash shortages. Elmar Brok, the EU's chief observer, said many voters,
particularly young women, left voting queues in frustration at
long delays. The EU has not yet made a conclusion on how to
judge the vote, he said. "In some cases it (voting queues) works very smoothly but in
others we see that it is totally disorganised and that people
become angry, people leave," Brok told reporters in Harare. "We have not found out whether they is coincidence or bad
organisation," he said. Chamisa on Monday said there was an attempt to "suppress and
frustrate" the vote in urban areas where he has strong support.
He offered no evidence to support his claim and there was no
immediate comment from the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. Mugabe emerged from eight months of obscurity on the eve of
the election to announce he would vote for the opposition,
surprising Mnangagwa who accused him of striking a deal with
Chamisa. Read: Victory is certain, Zimbabwe opposition candidate tells voters Click here for the latest political news
