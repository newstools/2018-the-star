Hiribae Mame stood waist-deep
in water outside her wrecked house in eastern Kenya, one of
around 200,000 people forced to flee by weeks of floods,
landslides and heavy rains. Kenya's Red Cross estimates at least 100 have also died in
the downpours since early April, a humanitarian disaster that it
says needs emergency funding. "I have lost 12 chicken and four goats. We were not able to
save all of them and I can't access the house because the door
can't open," said the mother-of-four in the town of Tana River
in lower Coast region. Her youngest daughter clung to her neck, the girl's feet
just touching the water. Mattresses and wreckage floated by as
handmade boats ferried people, animals and goods to safer
ground. Floods have blocked major roads across central and northern
Kenya and coastal areas - the route from the capital Nairobi to
the main port Mombasa was under water last week. Eight people were killed when mudslides destroyed their
homes as they slept in the hilly central region of Murang'a on
Friday night, said Kenya Red Cross Secretary General Abbas
Gullet. Gullet said the military and police had deployed helicopters
for rescue missions but more efforts were needed. Outbreaks of water-borne diseases were another concern
across Kenya, he added. "We would urge the national government to declare this a
national disaster so that deliberate effort can be made and
resources mobilised to help the affected people," Gullet told
reporters in the capital on Sunday. "We need a national disaster management fund set up." Read: Arrest locals who defy landslide warnings, Sabina Chege tells police Also read: Death toll in Murang'a landlside rises to five Click here for the latest political news
