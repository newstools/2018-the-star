Mali's President Ibrahim Boubacar
Keita announced on state TV on Monday that he would run for
re-election in a poll scheduled for the end of July. Keita, 73, had been widely expected to run for a second
term, but had not confirmed his intention. He faces growing
political opposition in the capital Bamako, especially among a
disaffected youth, and a raging Islamist insurgency and
tit-for-tat ethnic killing in the north. "I present myself as a candidate in the presidential
election of July 29," Keita said on state TV. "I ask you to
trust in me again." A dozen other candidates have announced their candidacy, the
strongest of which is seen as opposition leader Soumaila Cisse,
a former finance minister. Rising violence across Mali has cast doubt over the
feasibility of elections in some parts, especially the north,
where Islamist groups have exploited chaos and lawlessness to
use the desert region as a springboard for attacks. Dozens of ethnic Tuareg and Fulani civilians have also been
killed in inter -communal violence in the north, stoked by the
Islamists, while insurgents have killed scores of UN
peacekeepers and government soldiers. Growth has hovered around 5 pe rcent, owing to strong cotton
and gold output, but population growth at over 3 per cent has
eaten into those gains. Corruption remains endemic, and Mali
ranks 175 on the UN Human Development Index, only 12 up from
the bottom. Click here for the latest political news
