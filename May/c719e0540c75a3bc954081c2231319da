Congolese soldiers and park rangers
have launched an operation to locate two British tourists
kidnapped in the country's volatile eastern borderlands, an army
spokesman said. Unidentified armed men ambushed the group on Friday morning
north of Goma, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo's
North Kivu province, inside Virunga National Park. One park ranger was killed during the incident in Africa's
oldest national park and three other people, including the
British citizens, were abducted. "With Virunga National Park being within our zone of action,
we have joined the park rangers for search operations for the
people taken hostages," Major Guillaume Kaiko Ndjike, the army's
spokesman in North Kivu, said on Saturday. Britain's Foreign Office said on Friday it was in contact
with the Congolese authorities following an incident involving
two British nationals and its staff were providing support to
their families. Eastern Congo has been the scene of successive waves of
violence over the past two and a half decades and was at the
epicentre of two wars between 1996 and 2003 that killed
millions, mainly through hunger and disease. Rebel groups and militias still control large swathes of the
territory. More than 175 rangers have died protecting Virunga
National Park, which is located in the rugged mountains and
volcanic plains adjacent to neighouring Rwanda and Uganda. It has nevertheless attracted a growing number of visitors
keen to visit its endangered mountain gorillas and the active
Nyiragongo volcano. Click here for the latest political news
